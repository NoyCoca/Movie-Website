        <p id="txt">Wonder Woman is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name, produced by
            DC Films in association with RatPac Entertainment and Chinese company Tencent Pictures, and distributed by
            Warner Bros. Pictures. It is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).[6] Directed by Patty
            Jenkins from a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, Wonder Woman
            stars Gal Gadot in the title role, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie
            Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. It is the second live action theatrical film featuring Wonder Woman following her
            debut in 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[7] In Wonder Woman, the Amazon princess Diana sets out
            to stop World War I, believing the conflict was started by the longtime enemy of the Amazons, Ares, after
            American pilot and spy Steve Trevor crash-lands on their island Themyscira and informs her about it.</p>
